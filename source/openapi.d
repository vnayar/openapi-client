 * - multipleOf

 * - exclusiveMaximum
 * - minimum
 * - exclusiveMinimum
 * - maxLength
 * - minLength
 * - pattern (This string SHOULD be a valid regular expression, according to the Ecma-262 Edition

 * - maxItems
 * - minItems
 * - uniqueItems
 * - maxProperties
 * - minProperties
 * - required
 * - enum
 *
 * The following properties are taken from the JSON Schema definition but their definitions were
 * adjusted to the OpenAPI Specification:
 *
 * - type - Value MUST be a string. Multiple types via an array are not supported.
 * - allOf - Inline or referenced schema MUST be of a [OasSchema] object and not a standard
 *   JSON Schema.
 * - oneOf - Inline or referenced schema MUST be of a [OasSchema] object and not a standard
 *   JSON Schema.
 * - anyOf - Inline or referenced schema MUST be of a [OasSchema] object and not a standard
 *   JSON Schema.
 * - not - Inline or referenced schema MUST be of a [OasSchema] object and not a standard
 *   JSON Schema.
 * - items - Value MUST be an object and not an array. Inline or referenced schema MUST be of a
 *   [OasSchema] object and not a standard JSON Schema. items MUST be present if the type is array.
 * - properties - Property definitions MUST be a [OasSchema] object and not a standard JSON Schema
 *   (inline or referenced).
 * - additionalProperties - Value can be boolean or object. Inline or referenced schema MUST be of a
 *   [OasSchema] object and not a standard JSON Schema. Consistent with JSON Schema,
 *   additionalProperties defaults to true.
 * - description - CommonMark syntax MAY be used for rich text representation.
 * - format - See Data Type Formats for further details. While relying on JSON Schema's defined
 *   formats, the OAS offers a few additional predefined formats.
 * - default - The default value represents what would be assumed by the consumer of the input as
 *   the value of the schema if one is not provided. Unlike JSON Schema, the value MUST conform to
 *   the defined type for the [OasSchema] object defined at the same level. For example, if type is
 *   string, then default can be "foo" but cannot be 1.
 *
 * Alternatively, any time a [OasSchema] object can be used, a [OasReference] object can be used in
